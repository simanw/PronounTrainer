## Push notifications

If you want to use the app with your own server and want push notification to work you have to set them up:

* Register at https://firebase.google.com/, [set up the project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup) if you have not done so already.
* [Download your own](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/client) config file `GoogleService-Info.plist` and place it in the `Tinodios/` folder of your copy of the project. The config file contains keys specific to your Firebase/FCM registration.
* Copy Google-provided server key to `tinode.conf`, see details [here](https://github.com/tinode/chat/blob/master/docs/faq.md#q-what-are-the-options-for-enabling-push-notifications).

## Translations

The app is currently available in English (default), Simplified Chinese, Spanish. Pull requests with more translations are welcome. Two files need to be translated: [storyboard](Tinodios/en.lproj/Main.strings) and [code](en.lproj/Localizable.strings).

  # Pronoun Trainer
  
  This innovative project aims to help people get used to gender-neutral pronouns as minorities like LGBTQ rising up. It tends to detect misused pronouns and alert users while they are typing text in a mobile instant messaging app, which needs essentially real time responsiveness. Processing the data at the edge of clouds puts it closer to the source and can enable the AI interfaces running the industrial application to act in real-time. This project takes advantages of public edge computing platform to reduce response time to single-digit millisecond.
